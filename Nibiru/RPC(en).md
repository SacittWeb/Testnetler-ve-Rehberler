## Hello everyone.

`Error: error unmarshalling: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value` to solve this error we need to change RPC.

### Run the following command and get rid of this error.

```
wget -O rpcen.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brsbrc/Testnetler-ve-Rehberler/main/Nibiru/rpcen.sh && chmod +x rpcen.sh && ./rpcen.sh
```

### Remember, we should focus on the solution, not the problem. :D
