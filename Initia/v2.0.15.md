# Initia Update Guide

This guide outlines the steps to update Initia project to version v0.2.15 using a bash script.

**1. Download and Execute the Script**

Paste the following command into your terminal to download and execute the bash script that updates Initia to version v0.2.15:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackowltr/Testnetler-ve-Rehberler/main/Initia/v0.2.15.sh | bash
```

This command downloads the script and runs it automatically.

**2. Update Process**

The script will automatically perform the following steps:

- Change directory to the home directory.
- Remove the existing 'initia' directory if it exists.
- Clone the Initia project from GitHub.
- Change directory to the cloned project.
- Checkout the specified version v0.2.15.
- Start the project compilation.
- Move the compiled 'initiad' binary to the appropriate location.
- Check the updated version of Initia.
- If the update is successful, restart the 'initiad' service and follow its logs.

**3. Post-Update Checks**

After the update process completes, use the following commands to check the status of the 'initiad' service and monitor its logs:

```bash
sudo systemctl status initiad
sudo journalctl -u initiad -f
```
