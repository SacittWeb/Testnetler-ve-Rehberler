The Nexus platform offers two ways to earn rewards:  
1. Using the web interface.  
2. Using the CLI (Command Line Interface) for potentially higher earnings.  

## Step 1: Create a Nexus Account  

1. Visit [https://beta.nexus.xyz/](https://beta.nexus.xyz/).  
2. Sign up using your email address.  
3. After registration, you will find a **Provider ID** at the bottom-left corner of the page.  
   - Copy this ID (youâ€™ll need it in later steps).  

## Step 2: CLI Installation  

To install the CLI tool, paste and run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev git-all
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackowltr/Testnetler-ve-Rehberler/refs/heads/main/Nexus/cli.sh | sh
```

This command will download and run the necessary files on your system.  

## Step 3: CLI Configuration  

Once the installation is complete:  

1. When prompted, type **`yes`** and press Enter.  
2. Next, paste the **Provider ID** you copied earlier and press Enter.  

`Example ID: E5XXXXXXXNZ7AcXXXXGpVXXXXN83`

## Step 4: Earning Process  

After configuration, the system will begin operating via the CLI.  
- You are now ready to start earning on the Nexus platform!
